Each module folder contains two folders:
1. *Notes* contains lecture notes, code, and datasets from the video lectures.
2. *Homework* contains code, datasets, and answers to the homework sets.

FYI I am taking notes in Jupyter notebooks and then publishing them to a [Github Pages site](https://michael-mauldin.github.io/data-engineering-zoomcamp-2024/) using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
